# Way of working
We evaluate that our team is on the level "Collaborating". The checklist for each previous stage are mostly fulfilled. An exception can be made for a group member who had to be absent for a part of the work due to personal reasons, which puts the items "The team is working as one cohesive unit" and "Team members are accepting work" on somewhat shaky ground, however with their inclusion we feel that all checklist items up until that point are met, especially the items "Communication within the team is open and honest" and "The team is focused on achieving the team mission". It is due to this exception that we do not feel that we are at the "Performing" level yet, however, our work in Assignment 2 has been to a standard where most items in the "Performing" checklist are satisfied, and we might reach this level in the near future.
